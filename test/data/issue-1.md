# Custom reporting is fundamentally broken

I am absolutely frustrated with the current state of reporting capabilities. It's 2024, and yet, the basic functionality of custom reporting is still not a built-in feature. This is utterly unacceptable for a platform that claims to be user-friendly and efficient.

## Steps to Reproduce

Attempt to generate a report that fits specific business needs.

Realize that the only options available are the generic, one-size-fits-all reports.

Search for a custom reporting feature, only to find out it doesn't exist unless you jump through hoops with third-party integrations or complex workarounds.

## Expected Result

A seamless, built-in custom reporting feature that allows users to tailor reports to their specific requirements without needing additional tools or technical expertise.

## Actual Result

Frustration and wasted time trying to find a solution that should be readily available.

## Impact

This oversight is causing significant inefficiencies in our workflow. We are unable to extract the data we need in a format that is useful for our business analysis. This is not just a minor inconvenience; it is a major hindrance to our operations.

## Additional Comments

It's baffling that such a fundamental feature is missing. I urge the development team to prioritize this and provide a solution immediately. We need a built-in custom reporting feature that is intuitive and robust. Please address this issue with the urgency it deserves.
