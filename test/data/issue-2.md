## Title
Lack of Built-in Custom Reporting Feature

#### Overview
Users are unable to generate custom reports tailored to specific business needs due to the absence of a built-in custom reporting feature. This limitation leads to inefficiencies and frustration as users must rely on third-party integrations or complex workarounds.

#### Environment
* Operating System: Windows 11
* Browser: Google Chrome 116.0.5845.110
* Device: Dell Latitude 7420
* Software Version: Data and Reporting System v2.3.1
* Database: PostgreSQL 13.3
* Network: Corporate VPN

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Log in to the application using valid credentials.
2. Navigate to the "Reports" section from the main dashboard.
3. Click on "Create New Report."
4. Attempt to select specific data fields for the MediRoute system.
5. Observe the available options and attempt to customize the report layout or data filters.
6. Search for any built-in custom reporting features or options.
7. Note the absence of such features and the reliance on third-party integrations or manual workarounds.

#### Expected behavior
A seamless, built-in custom reporting feature that allows users to tailor reports to their specific requirements without needing additional tools or technical expertise.

#### Actual behavior
When attempting to build a report for the MediRoute System,
there are no default options, report layouts, or data filters.
The system does not throw any errors,
but the functionality is incomplete for this scenario.

#### Severity
This issue causes significant inefficiencies in workflow and hinders business operations.

#### Priority
High priority, as it is a major hindrance to operations and requires urgent attention.
