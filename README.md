As [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jira_(software)) explains:
> When launched in 2002, Jira was purely issue tracking software, targeted at software developers.

Although Jira has evolved into much more,
that oldest part of Jira means we know a thing or 2 about defects.
This project captures some of that experience in the form of an AI Agent
to evaluate the quality of a defect report (aka an issue or [bug](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/features/bug-tracking)).

You can learn from it directly by reading
the [agent instructions](./prompts/agent-instructions.md) (ie the prompt).
You can explore interactively with "no code".
Just copy/paste those instructions into [Rovo Agent instructions](https://support.atlassian.com/rovo/docs/write-instructions-for-your-agent/).
You can explore as a "pro code" project by forking,
and modifying the prompt and code-based actions.
